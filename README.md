## CryptoTracker
**CryptoTracker** is a cryptocurrency market tracker, which lists the top 50 coins (ordered by market cap), along with interactive trading charts to analyze the performance of the coin. Feel free to play around with the site [here](https://crypto-trackr.vercel.app/)!

For each coin, you can also find the following properties:
* Daily percent change
* Current price
* All time high
* Market cap
* Block time
* Hashing algorithm
* Volume

## Workflows
### Coin search
By default, the top 50 coins are ordered by market cap. If a coin is hard to find, just use the search bar!
